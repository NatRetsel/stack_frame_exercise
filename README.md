# stack_frame_exercise
A simple program illustrating the memory address offset of stack frames in nested function calls and the allocation and deallocation of stack frames in successive function calls. Learning journal documented [here](https://medium.com/@natretsel/program-memory-layout-stack-and-heap-0e644bab7462).

## Nested stack frame exercise
Exercise illustrates the creation of new stack frames by computing the offset of each function's frame address in a nested function call of similar functions.

## Same stack frame exercise
Exercise illustrates allocation and deallocation of sequential functions and occupying the same frame stack with sequential function call of similar functions.
